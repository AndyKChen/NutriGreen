# NutriGreen
Nutrition platform for a healthier diet and a healthier planet.

## 1) Discovery Process 

In recent years, I have seen an increasing number of headlines and posts regarding climate change, yet I see a lot less being done to prevent it. Thus before I began the project, I started researching a lot about the global issue. **It turns out that the leading cause of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, are highly related to the food we eat.** Here are some facts I found regarding nutrition and climate change: 

<ul>
<li>Food accounts for 10% - 30% of a household’s carbon footprint</li>
<li>Food is responsible for approximately 26% of global GHG emissions</li>
<li>Worldwide, approximately 13.7 billion metric tons    of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) emitted through the food supply chain per year</li>
</ul>

Given my research into this topic, I created NutriGreen which aims to integrate nutrition and environmental sustainability in a way that is also useful for the user. 

## 2) About the Platform

**NutriGreen is a revolutionary lifestyle platform designed to help you pursue healthy eating habits while striving to care for the environment.** We aim to utilize the power of technology to guide users in improving their diet, and provide awareness of their personal carbon footprint. Essentially, NutriGreen combines a useful dieting tool with environmental consciousness seamlessly in one application.
